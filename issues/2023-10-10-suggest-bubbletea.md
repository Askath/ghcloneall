### Suggestion to Use Charm Bubbletea for UI/UX Improvement

I would like to suggest considering the use of [Charm Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for enhancing the UI and UX of the project. Bubbletea is a powerful library that can help in building rich terminal applications with a focus on user experience and ease of use.

#### Benefits of Using Bubbletea:
- **Declarative UI**: Allows building UIs in a more intuitive way.
- **State Management**: Simplifies managing application state.
- **Customizability**: Highly customizable components that can fit various design needs.

I believe integrating Bubbletea could significantly enhance the user interaction with the application. Looking forward to discussing this further!
